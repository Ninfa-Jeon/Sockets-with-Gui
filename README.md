# Sockets-with-Gui

This project simply connects two Java programs as Server and Client using Sockets.
The program is given a Graphical User Interface(GUI) using Swing. The communication 
between the client and server windows is made possible using Threads. The sending
and receiving of messages is done on two separate threads, thus displaying the use 
of multi-threading, gui and sockets in one project.
